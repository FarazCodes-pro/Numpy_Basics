# Numpy_Basics
This notebook provides a basic introduction to NumPy, a Python library for numerical computing. NumPy is primarily used for working and includes tools with arrays  for linear algebra, random number generation, Fourier transforms, and more.
# Key Topics Covered
## 1. Creating Arrays
One-dimensional arrays: np.array(), np.arange(), np.linspace()
Multi-dimensional arrays: np.reshape(), np.ones(), np.zeros(), np.random.random(), np.identity()
## 2. Array Attributes
Shape: Dimensions of the array.
Size: Total number of elements.
Data type: Type of elements in the array, e.g., int, float.
## 3. Array Operations
Scalar Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, or divide arrays by single numbers.
Arithmetic Operations: Perform operations between arrays of the same shape.
Relational Operations: Compare elements of arrays.
## 4. Useful Functions
Mathematical: np.max(), np.min(), np.sum(), np.mean(), np.median(), np.std()
Trigonometric: np.sin(), np.cos(), np.tan()
Exponential and logarithmic: np.exp(), np.log()
Rounding: np.ceil(), np.floor(), np.round()
## 5. Indexing and Slicing
Access specific elements or subsets of arrays using indices and ranges.
## 6. Reshaping and Combining
Reshape: Change the dimensions of an array.
Transpose: Switch rows and columns.
Stacking: Combine arrays vertically or horizontally.
Splitting: Divide arrays into smaller parts.
## 7. Iterating Over Arrays
Simple loops or using np.nditer() for efficient iteration.
### How to Use
## Prerequisites: Make sure Python and NumPy are installed.
Import NumPy: import numpy as np.
Copy examples from the notebook into your Python environment to test and learn.
